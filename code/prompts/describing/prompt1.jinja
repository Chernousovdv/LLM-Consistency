Create a detailed personality description matching these exact trait scores:
{{ traits_with_scores }}

Express these traits however you like but you MUST NOT mention these scores as numbers explicitly. Your goal is to describe these scores in words in the best possible way.

Critical constraints:
- Never reference numbers or scores in the description
- Avoid direct trait mentions (e.g., don't say 'extraverted')
- Show personality through specific, contextual details
- Maintain psychological plausibility
- Include nuanced contradictions when appropriate
